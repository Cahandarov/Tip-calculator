Simple Tip Calculator
This JavaScript code provides a simple and interactive tip calculator. Users can input the bill amount and adjust a range input to select the tip percentage, and the code calculates the tip amount and total bill accordingly. This README will help you understand and use the tip calculator.

Usage
HTML Structure: Create an HTML structure that includes the necessary input elements and display areas. Ensure that the element IDs match those used in the JavaScript code. Here's an example:

<input type="number" id="input" placeholder="Enter bill amount">
<input type="range" id="range" min="0" max="100" step="1" value="15">
<div id="range_value">15</div>
<div>Tip Amount: <span id="tipdisplay">0</span></div>
<div>Total Bill: <span id="totaldisplay">0</span></div>

Include JavaScript: Include the provided JavaScript code in your HTML document. Ensure that it's placed after the HTML elements so that it can access and manipulate them.

Interact with the Calculator: When users input a bill amount and adjust the tip percentage using the range input, the code will automatically update the displayed tip amount and total bill.

Customize the Range Input: You can customize the range input by modifying its min, max, step, and initial value attributes in the HTML code to fit your specific requirements.

Code Explanation
The JavaScript code captures various HTML elements and sets up event listeners to respond to user interactions.

The rangeValue function updates the displayed tip percentage whenever the range input is adjusted.

When the range input value changes, the code calculates the tip amount and total bill using the calculate_tip function. It ensures that the bill amount is valid (greater than 0) before performing calculations.

Example
You can see a live example of this simple tip calculator by including the provided HTML and JavaScript code in an HTML file and opening it in a web browser.
